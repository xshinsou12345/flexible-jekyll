### Can I make a game in 4 months?!

This pet project was to learn about game development and level design. I decided to work on this during the summer (2019) as I felt it that I could create a small game in just 3-4 months. The game engine that I developed the on was GameMaker Studio 2, it was simple to use and the coding aspects was fairly similar to Javascript (in a way). I used a tutorial by Shaun Spalding on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn7FE3Tx391g1tWPv-1tv7Q">YouTube</a>, which gave me an in-depth look in the platform and how to code certain things. The game is a bit similar to the tutorial, as I followed it, but very different as the assets and level design were done by myself.

<br>

### Planning and more planning

When I first started this project, I had an initial idea of what the game was to be. It was to be in 2D and a platform game. The idea was to build a platform game with a single room; with random enemies and power ups; which when the player defeats all the enemies, the player will move to the next level.

I decided to make levels (like in Mario Maker) instead of one level, to make things more varied rather than one static room. I felt it would bring more interesting aspects of the game and making it bigger. Although, this posed a few challenges such as coding and seeing what is possible within the game engine, but I managed to make it work.

Some things that were challenging were:

- Level design
- Power ups
- Jumping mechanics
- Enemies

Majority of the assets were created within the game engine, which was very fun to do and was enough for my needs. I kept things simple with my sprites and wanted to create something that had an 8-bit feel. Sound effects were done by a tool called <a href="https://www.bfxr.net/">Bfxr</a>, but I decided to opt out of the BGM as I felt that the game will be too short for the player to hear.

### Level design!

Creating levels was interesting but very fun as I thought about the player and what the player would expect. I wanted to create levels that were a bit challenging and encouraged exploration. Which led to making the enemies a bit stronger than usual. My mindset was that, if the player is struggling to defeat the boss at the end of each level, they would explore to find a power up that would enable them to defeat the boss. If they don't, it would take a while for them.

While testing (on my own), I've found certain strategies such as jumping and shooting or standing on a ledge where the boss can't shoot at me. I felt that it would make the game easy to "cheese" but ultimately everyone plays games in their own way, so I decided to leave it.

With power ups, I decided to hide them somewhere in each level. The power ups don't carry on to other levels so the player must find the power ups in each level. I couldnâ€™t code in power ups that transfer over to different levels, as I believe that is a limitation of the game engine (or perhaps I wasn't able to find any documentation on this). Power ups in each level, provide high damage as the player progresses.

### The finished game

### The takeaways

I felt that the result was great but not perfect as there was a lot to improve. I tested this game with a few friends and the feedback that they gave were:

- The game is simple and straight forward, which is a positive
- The art and sprites are cute and fun to look at
- Jumping can be tightened up a bit as it was a bit awkward sometimes
- The bosses are a bit too hard if the player doesn't find the upgrade, since the Slime dies if it gets hit by the boss
- Level design could be improved as it feels small and tight
- A health system could be implemented, which would improve the game greatly

Coding the entire game was very simple, even with the tutorial. From my own research, GameMaker Studio 2 has its own programming language called GML (GameMaker Language). Which is quite interesting as when I was developing smaller parts of code, such as the power up system (and other things that didn't make it to the final game), it seemed to be very JavaScript like - Which was perfect as I was able to understand how the code worked and how to develop code for certain systems.

Hearing the feedback from my friends was great as I wanted to improve the game further and I think I will do so later. Overall, I learned quite a bit about game development and its hardships. It takes a lot of time to create a video game, from asset creation to coding to testing. My respect to indie developers who put in their heart and soul into their games, has greatly increased.

From an UX/UI perspective, I ultimately decided to keep things simple and accessible to the player. I added various signs at the beginning to provide the player the controls and I felt that the controls can be easily figured out initially. From the testing, this was the case which was great but overall lots of improvements needs to be made to level design and mechanics. Regardless of that, I had fun creating this and hope to move on to my passion project of creating a full-fledged game in Unity.
