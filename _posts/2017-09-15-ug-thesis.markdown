<td markdown="span" style="vertical-align: top; text-align: left;">This project was an exploration into game UI design and also applying what I've learned in my courses into this competition. This competition was to modernize a UI from an existing Ubisoft IP, which followed a brief and criteria on what the judges were looking for. The final deliverables were given in a form of a UI style guide, UI mock-ups, and also UI animations. The overall project was placed 2nd place in the competition.</td>

<td markdown="span" style="vertical-align: top; text-align: left;">UI can be challenging especially in video games as it provides the user with something to interact with and to read information from. Although, older games follow old design practices and are often not up to speed with modern design practices. With this in mind, how might we modernize a UI from a game that was developed in 2013, while keeping in mind accessibility and design?</td>

<td markdown="span" style="vertical-align: top; text-align: left;">This project was a individiual competition (no teams allowed). I worked on all aspects of the UI from start to finish, in addition to the animations in After Effects. A total of 3-4 months were given to complete the piece of submission, which included a mid-competition review from the judges.</td>
