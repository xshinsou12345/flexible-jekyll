### The challenges of remote learning
 
Remote learning has been always challenging due to the absence of in-person learning, although technology has enhanced this through virtual environments that allow students to interact with content in different ways. Working with Open University, a fully online university, we were tasked to create a solution or an MVP (Most Viable Product) to enable UK students to learn more about the UK courtroom. Due to the pandemic, we learned that access to these courtrooms was restricted and found out that Law students participate in “mooting”, which were mock trials – To compete and develop their communication and presentation skills. This was another use case that we saw as an opportunity that we could create.
 
<br> 
 
### The start of a long journey
 
We followed a design process that was developed by IDEO from the book called Design Thinking for Educators. It is focused on designing for students, so was perfect for us. The design process consisted of a framework of:
 
- Discovery
- Interpretation
- Ideation
- Experimentation
- Evolution
 
Following this framework provided us a structure when designing and performing user testing on our prototypes.

<br>

### Delving into Education Technology
 
To start the project, we started the Discovery phase by doing design and secondary research. From our preliminary research, we found:
 
- Education Technology continues to evolve by using VR to simulate real-life professional experiences like health care
- With the pandemic, the majority of Law schools are going online
- There are existing technologies that actual courts use (during the pandemic) for their trials, such as software like Zoom or Teams
 
This secondary research provided a general idea on the Education Technology area and what was available. We saw Unity and its applications of Education Technology in the form of simulations in health care and automotive. This was what OU was looking for, a virtual courtroom where students can go into 
a 3D environment with avatars and learn the basics of the courtroom via interactions around the area. As we proceeded to do primary research, we found that what OU wanted was opposite what students needed.

<br>

### Research and more research
 
To get a better idea of what students wanted, me and my team went to perform surveys on students in the Law program. Our goal through these surveys was to:
 
- Determine the level of technology that students have
- What is their comfort level with technology
- What are their expectations of a Virtual Courtroom
 
Our findings were:
 
- 73% had laptops compared to 27% had desktops
- Student’s expectations of a “virtual courtroom” were a 3D courtroom environment that extended functionality beyond a Zoom or MS Teams call
- The importance of mooting for students (mock trials), as it was a core activity for Law students at the OU Law program
 
We also interviewed current students, alumni (recent graduates), and lawyers who judge moots, to gain a further understanding of what their needs were and to get an idea of how these mock trials were run. 
 
From our interviews, we found:
- Video was important in a virtual environment as students want to read the judge’s reactions and body language just like in an in-person mock trial
- Students want additional tools to help them track specific things like time and notes
- The need for a higher-level interactive experience compared to Zoom or MS Teams
 
It was quite clear that students want a tool to facilitate and learn mooting compared to what OU thought, was a tool to learn about the courtroom. This was in line with our assumptions that students wanted both.

<br>

### What are our options?
 
Moving to the Ideation phase, we weighed our options:
 
- VR
- “Deluxe Zoom”
- 3D Virtual Environment
 
We picked a 3D virtual environment using Unity as a development platform. Based on our primary research, students wanted an interactive experience that used video and audio. Since Unity was very flexible as a development platform (i.e. video, audio, matchmaking), we saw an opportunity to use it for the MVP.

<br>
 
### Prototyping and beyond
 
While my team members focused on other aspects of the MVP like the back end, 3D modeling, and development, my focus was the UI and visual design of the tool. I started creating a user flow in how students would navigate their way into the tool. My goals were to be as simple as possible because, from the surveys and research we performed, these students don’t have much technical knowledge so creating something straightforward will avoid problems.

I also wanted an interesting way that would attract students to use this tool as we also found out that, not every student wants an extra piece of software to install or use. Some prefer the ease of use of Zoom or MS Teams, as it is very simple to set up. This was when I experimented with 3D menus, where it uses a 3D environment as a menu. The goal was to have something attractive while pushing the boundaries of UI design.

Although my concern was that this would be more diegetic rather than functional, so the idea was scrapped for something more straightforward:

<br>  
  
### A new challenger appears
 
Several challenges came about when designing the UI was carefully balancing the amount of information shown in the user interface. Since we saw from our primary research that the technology level is relatively low, we had to make it straightforward as possible.
 
Although this was difficult due to the features, we wanted to incorporate such as character creation. Some of these systems like avatar editing, the connection screen, and even movement, were borrowed from game design concepts. Since the students we interviewed and surveyed didn’t have much knowledge of games, we had to confirm our assumptions through user testing the UI with a few students.
 
<br>  
  
### Testing, testing, and more testing
 
User testing was done to identify areas of improvement in the user flow, text, and any other issues in the UI. Since this was an initial passthrough, we tested via a digital prototype in Adobe XD. I performed tests using scenarios with a few students, which resulted in feedback:
 
- The UI was straightforward and intuitive
- Liked the customization options
- Students liked the overall visual design of the UI and menus
 
Although, some pain points were:
 
- The language used was vague and it should match what Law students are used to
- Having a balance of information and white space, so it doesn’t look cluttered
- Some systems were unclear like interactions and movement
 
Along with this feedback, I focused on a few things:
 
- Implementing a font that would be easy to read
- Tutorials when the student enters the count room for movement and interactions
- Adjusting the language of the UI, so it is more familiar with Law students
  
<br> 

### The final UI
 
The most important aspect that was changed was simplifying the UI but also having a level of detail. This meant re-visiting fonts, the text, and also refining the overall layout of the UI. This came with changes to the user flow to keep it even more straightforward, so there wouldn’t be any frustration on the other side. Further features were added such as UI customization, being able to turn certain aspects of the UI on and off – This was to prevent distractions for the students when they are presenting their submissions in the mock trial.

### Putting it all together
 
As the MVP started to take shape with the work from my team members and the UI was close to being finalized, I started working on different aspects of the 3D environment. Things like adding small objects to make the environment more realistic and implementing features that OU wanted. Such features were:
 
- An information system that the student can interact with to get information about the history of the courtroom
- Sitting and standing
- Further enhancements to the environment such as signage and small objects to create more realism and detail
  
<br> 
  
### Even more testing
 
As the MVP is finalized in the last few weeks of the project, such as final UI implementation, 3D environment work, and character customization, we tested the MVP with students to get an understanding of what can be improved in a short duration of time. We also wanted to get a general idea of what students thought of the tool and how they can use it for other things. What we found was:
 
- Students were generally positive and excited about the tool as they haven’t encountered something like this in their program
- It would be very useful for first- and second-year students to learn about the UK courts through this tool as it is almost accurate to the real thing
- Students we tested with saw an opportunity of using the tool for social gatherings, since there was a webcam feed and audio
- Students felt very intimate just like in real life due to the moving avatars, webcam, and audio. They mentioned that it felt like an actual physical interaction but digitally
- The overall UI was very positive as students were able to connect to a room without issues and were very appreciative of the tutorials provided as some students were not familiar with controls from video games (WASD)
- Students were very much appreciative about the level of detail that we put, such as books, cups, plants, and such, that would mimic a courtroom environment.

### Takeaways
 
> Talking to the user base is important
 
I learned that talking to users was very important to identify their needs. Talking to the OU Law students was very important and proved our assumptions at the start of the project. What OU assumed was way different compared to what students told us, which was that they wanted an interactive experience with video – Rather than a virtual world with just simply avatars. We saw the tool providing a way for students to practice their presentation skills in a safe environment without trouble.
 
> Working collaboratively with team members who have different skillsets
 
This was the first time that I worked with two other peers from the Interaction Design program in this internship, who had different skill sets than myself. I learned to rely on my team members when I have problems like in Unity, coding, or 3D modeling. Relying on my teammates when I need it is great as they have some skills that I don’t necessarily have. In addition, if my teammates are having trouble, they can lean on me for help – Whether if it is design-related or anything in-between.
 
> The value of user testing and proving assumptions
 
Throughout this project, we user-tested with students to ensure that we are on the right track. I learned that doing this keeps us on our toes as sometimes students find things that we don’t realize that would be an issue. For example, a student pointed out that the signage should be improved as it was a bit confusing. Originally, I added the signage to make it realistic but didn’t realize that it would help students to find their way around the 3D environment. By constantly getting users involved with the design process, I learned that feedback will shape the final product that the students could happily use in the end.
