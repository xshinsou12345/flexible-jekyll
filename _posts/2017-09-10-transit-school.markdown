### Commuting, the bane of a student's existence

I think as students, majority of our time is mostly commuting back and forth to classes. At times, it is stressing because of its various issues like rush hour, overcrowding, delays, and other factors that would delay us from getting to class on time. For this project, the problem I had to solve was to create a solution to better the commute experience. We were encouraged to create anything from a physical product or digital.

I decided to focus on the shuttle system that Sheridan provides, which was cut down to just two campuses in the recent year due to funding. My reason for focusing on Sheridan’s shuttle system was a few factors: 

<br>

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="33.33%" />
<col width="33.33%" />
<col width="33.33%" />
</colgroup>
  <tr>
    <th align="center"><i class="fas fa-mobile-alt"></i></th>
    <th align="center"><i class="fas fa-bus-alt"></i></th>
    <th align="center"><i class="fas fa-users"></i></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">A lot of solutions that cater to commuters</td>
    <td align="center">Personal experiences with the shuttle were not so great </td>
    <td align="center">Creating something truly unique just for Sheridan students</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>    

### The solution

The idea was to integrate the shuttle and OneCard system that Sheridan uses (similarly to a card payment system) into an existing application called Transit. Eventually, the concept was to expand it to other school’s shuttle/payment systems so that students have the best of both worlds.

Why integrate rather than creating something new? I feel Transit is a perfect example of solving majority of issues that commuters face today, which is providing live transit data to the user. I figured, instead of reinventing the wheel, why not create a new function for an existing product.

<br>

### The research

I used the goal-directed design process or the user centered design process (as commonly known). It involved different steps from research to the final product:

![image](/images/posts/ta9.png)

Research was done through interviews, since this project was small - I interviewed two students: One first year, who uses the shuttle and the other, a second-year student who takes Oakville Transit. The research provided a few things:

<br>

<table>
  <colgroup>
<col width="33.33%" />
<col width="33.33%" />
<col width="33.33%" />
</colgroup>
  <tr>
    <th align="center"><i class="fas fa-heart"></i></th>
    <th align="center"><i class="fas fa-meh"></i></th>
    <th align="center"><i class="fas fa-arrows-alt-h"></i></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">A “love-hate” relationship <br> with the service</td>
    <td align="center">Dissatisfaction <br> with the service</td>
    <td align="center">Variability of <br> the service</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>   

Although, not everything was frustration as the interviews showed that they were happy that the service was there rather than not. Additional research was done in the form of observation, which was taking the shuttle and experiencing the commute - Which my conclusions were inline with the student who I interviewed.
From the research, personas were created and then scenarios (below) to simulate the functionality of the integration. Two personas that were created were:

<br>

<table>
  <colgroup>
<col width="15%" />
<col width="25%" />
<col width="20%" />
<col width="25%" />
<col width="15%" />
</colgroup>
  <tr>
    <th align="center"></th>
    <th align="center"><i class="fas fa-user-tie"></i></th>
    <th align="center"></th>
    <th align="center"><i class="fas fa-user-ninja"></i></th>
    <th align="center"></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="center"></th>
    <td align="center">Person A:<br> I take city transit!</td>
    <td align="center"></td>
    <td align="center">Person B:<br> I take the Sheridan shuttle!</td>
    <td align="center"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>    

Using the personas as a starting point, design requirements were created to understand what the user wants. After wards, scenarios were created to visualize how a user would use the function in a “perfect world”. Then it was off to create the wireframes and prototype.

### The solution

My solution was to integrate the shuttle service right into Transit. I felt rather than trying to force a solution on to an existing transit system with its own problems, I focused on the shuttle experience. By integrating Sheridan’s shuttle system and payment system into Transit, the application (Transit) can be used both ways: for students who commute using a city’s transit system and for students who use the school’s transportation system.

But wait! Why these functions? My goal was to create convenience for the student. To reload an OneCard with funds, the student has to login to the website to reload. This is rather annoying since the student would either: need a computer or do it on the browser on their phone. Purchasing tickets is in a similar fashion, why make things hard when you can do it on your phone with ease?

The final prototype included an Apple Watch app as I wanted to expand the functionality into the wearables area.

### The take aways
Throughout this project, the goal was to provide a solution to an existing problem through using the goal-oriented design process (or user centered design is commonly known as). It was fun and I used the skills that I gained from my previous recruitment experiences in interviewing and gathering/analyzing data. There were a few things that I learned through this project:

> Research, research, and research.

Research is important and I realize that it’s something that is needed to first understand the user and second, what the user wants. My goal was to create a solution that a student can use if he/she is using the shuttle. Although, it’s quite niche, I felt it was necessary due to the overall issues with the current system

> Being unique

I feel with this topic of transit, there are multiple solutions out there from Uber to Google Maps. All of these popular apps these days, are quite robust with it’s functionality and what it offers to the user regarding the commute to work or school. I learned it’s hard, to create something when many options exist and understanding the target market plus a USP (unique selling proposition) is important!

> The user is king

Through this project, I understood the importance of the user and what they want. I learned how to use the data that I got from interviews and translated it into what the user needs. It was hard because there’s just so much information, even with two interviews. I wanted to add more but keeping it simple was the best way to go.
